## What it predicts

This component predicts the likelihood of glaucoma based on various eye-related features. The models are trained to classify whether a patient has glaucoma or not, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and treatment. 

Our models utilize features such as border and color descriptors, as well as other eye-related metrics to make predictions. The models are designed to be robust and accurate, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Before making predictions, the data undergoes thorough preprocessing to ensure quality and reliability. The models are trained on a diverse dataset to generalize well across different patient profiles. The next image show a sample of the data used for training:

You can find the trained models in the `models` directory.
